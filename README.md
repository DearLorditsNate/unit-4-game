# Crystal Collector

A jQuery-based number matching game.

## How to Play:

You will be given a random target number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the target number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the target number.

You learn the value of each crystal by clicking on it and seeing how it affects your score.

Each time when the game starts, the crystals will have different values.

**Gameplay features include:**
* Random target number generation
* Random crystal value generation
  * Doesn't allow for duplicate numbers
* Win/loss counters
* Automatically starts a new round with new randomly generated numbers after a win/loss
